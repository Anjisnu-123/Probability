# Data Analysis and Visualization Concepts

This repository covers various concepts related to data analysis and visualization, including:

## 1. Introduction to Frequency Distribution

- **Definition of Frequency Distribution**: Frequency distribution refers to the tabular or graphical representation of the distribution of a variable, showing the number of observations (frequency) within each of several non-overlapping intervals or classes.
- **Steps to Calculate Frequency Distribution**:
  1. Identify the variable of interest.
  2. Determine the range (difference between the highest and lowest values) of the variable.
  3. Set the intervals or categories for the variable.
  4. Count the frequency (number of observations) for each interval or category.
  5. Represent the frequency distribution graphically.
- **Graphical Representation of Frequency Distribution**:
  - Bar Chart
  - Histogram
  - Pie Chart
  - Frequency Polygon
  - Cumulative Frequency Curve (Ogive)
- **Types of Frequency Curves**:
  - Normal Distribution
  - Skewed Distribution
  - Bimodal Distribution
  - Uniform Distribution
  - Exponential Distribution
- **Pros and Cons of Frequency Distribution**:
  - Pros: Provides a clear visualization of the distribution of a variable, helps in identifying patterns, and supports decision-making.
  - Cons: Can be affected by the choice of intervals or categories, may not accurately represent the underlying distribution, and can be sensitive to outliers.
