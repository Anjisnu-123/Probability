# Introduction to Probability

## To Study
- Hidden Markov Models
- Markov Models

## Sample Space

### What is a Sample Space?
A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of a probabilistic experiment. It serves as the foundation for defining events and calculating probabilities.

**Example:** 
When flipping a coin, the sample space \(S\) is defined as:
\[
S = \{ \text{Heads}, \text{Tails} \}
\]
For rolling a six-sided die, the sample space is:
\[
S = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}
\]

### What is an Event?
An **event** is a specific outcome or a set of outcomes from the sample space. Events can be simple (containing a single outcome) or compound (containing multiple outcomes).

### Importance of Sample Space
Sample spaces are essential for:
1. **Defining Probability:** They provide a context for calculating the likelihood of events.
2. **Event Identification:** They help in identifying and categorizing events for analysis.

---

## Event

### Definition and Importance
An **event** is a subset of a sample space. It is important because:
- It allows for the quantification of probabilities.
- It helps in understanding the likelihood of various outcomes.

### What is Likelihood?
**Likelihood** refers to the probability of an event occurring given certain conditions. It is crucial in statistical inference and model evaluation.

---

## Subset Representation of Events

### Notation and Representation
Events are typically represented using capital letters (e.g., \(A\), \(B\)). The subset of event \(A\) can be noted as:
\[
A \subseteq S
\]
where \(S\) is the sample space.

### Importance of Subset Representation
- **Clarity:** It simplifies the understanding of relationships between different events.
- **Calculations:** It aids in performing operations such as unions and intersections.

---

## Basic Terminology

### Definitions
- **Outcome:** The result of a single trial (e.g., landing on heads).
- **Trial:** A single performance of an experiment (e.g., one coin flip).
- **Favorable Outcome:** Outcomes that fulfill the criteria for a specific event.

---

## Probability as a Measure

### Relative Frequency Interpretation of Probability
Probability can be interpreted as the relative frequency of an event occurring after many trials:
\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes for } A}{\text{Total number of trials}}
\]

### Mutually Exclusive Events
Events are **mutually exclusive** if they cannot occur simultaneously. For example, when rolling a die, the events of rolling a 2 and a 5 are mutually exclusive.

### Union and Intersection of Events
- **Union (\(A \cup B\))**: The event that either \(A\) or \(B\) occurs.
- **Intersection (\(A \cap B\))**: The event that both \(A\) and \(B\) occur.

### Complement of an Event
The **complement** of an event \(A\) (denoted as \(A'\)) is the set of outcomes in the sample space that are not in \(A\). The probability of the complement is given by:
\[
P(A') = 1 - P(A)
\]

---

## Probability Axioms

### Axioms of Probability
1. **Non-negativity (Axiom 1):** 
   \[
   P(A) \geq 0 \quad \text{for any event } A
   \]

2. **Total Probability (Axiom 2):**
   \[
   P(S) = 1 \quad \text{(the probability of the entire sample space)}
   \]

3. **Additivity (Axiom 3):** For mutually exclusive events:
   \[
   P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
   \]

### Additional Consequences from Axioms
These axioms lead to essential properties in probability theory, such as the calculation of probabilities for combined events.

### Importance of Axioms
Understanding these axioms forms the backbone of probability theory, allowing for consistent calculations and reasoning in probabilistic contexts.

---

## Properties of Probability

### Key Properties
1. **Complement Rule:** 
   \[
   P(A') = 1 - P(A)
   \]

2. **Union of Events:**
   \[
   P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
   \]

3. **Conditional Probability:** 
   The probability of event \(A\) given that event \(B\) has occurred is defined as:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
   \]

4. **Probability of Impossible Event:** 
   \[
   P(\text{Impossible Event}) = 0
   \]

5. **Probability of Entire Sample Space:** 
   \[
   P(S) = 1
   \]

---

## Importance of Probability in AI and ML
Probability plays a crucial role in artificial intelligence and machine learning by:
- **Modeling Uncertainty:** It helps quantify uncertainty in predictions and decisions.
- **Inference:** Probabilistic models underpin many machine learning algorithms, facilitating reasoning under uncertainty.
- **Decision Making:** Probability aids in risk assessment and decision-making processes.

---

## Conditional Probability

### Definition
**Conditional probability** is the probability of an event \(A\) occurring given that another event \(B\) has occurred.

### Mathematical Formula
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

### Importance of Conditional Probability
- It provides insights into how events influence each other.
- It is fundamental in Bayesian analysis and decision-making.

### How to Calculate Conditional Probability
1. Identify the events \(A\) and \(B\).
2. Determine \(P(A \cap B)\) and \(P(B)\).
3. Apply the formula to calculate \(P(A|B)\).

---

## Independence of Events

### Definition
Two events \(A\) and \(B\) are **independent** if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.

### Mathematical Representation
\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
\]

### Example
Flipping a coin and rolling a die are independent events; the outcome of one does not influence the other.

### Implications of Independence
- Independent events allow for straightforward probability calculations.
- They are foundational in statistical modeling and analysis.

---

## Understanding Dependent and Independent Events in Data Science
In data science, recognizing whether events are dependent or independent is crucial for building accurate models, performing hypothesis testing, and conducting feature selection.

---

## Joint and Marginal Probabilities

### What Are Joint and Marginal Probabilities?
- **Joint Probability:** The probability of two events \(A\) and \(B\) occurring simultaneously:
  \[
  P(A \cap B)
  \]
- **Marginal Probability:** The probability of an event irrespective of other events:
  \[
  P(A) = \sum_{B} P(A \cap B)
  \]

### Why Do We Need Joint and Marginal Probabilities?
Understanding joint and marginal probabilities is essential for multi-variable analysis, allowing researchers to uncover relationships between variables.

---

## Total Probability Theorem

### Description
The Total Probability Theorem provides a way to compute the probability of an event based on partitioning the sample space into mutually exclusive events.

### Formula
If \(B_1, B_2, ..., B_n\) are mutually exclusive events that partition the sample space:
\[
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A|B_i) \cdot P(B_i)
\]

### Importance of the Total Probability Theorem
It simplifies the calculation of probabilities for complex events by breaking them down into simpler conditional components.

### Example Question
If a medical test has different probabilities of a positive result based on whether the patient has a condition, the Total Probability Theorem helps calculate the overall probability of a positive result.

---

## Bayes' Theorem

### Formula
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

### Components of Bayes' Theorem
- **Prior Probability (\(P(A)\))**: The initial belief about the probability of event \(A\).
- **Likelihood (\(P(B|A)\))**: The probability of observing event \(B\) given \(A\).
- **Marginal Likelihood (\(P(B)\))**: The total probability of event \(B\).
- **Posterior Probability (\(P(A|B)\))**: The updated probability of event \(A\) after observing \(B\).

### Applications of Bayes' Theorem
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Used in natural language processing to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral based on prior probabilities.
- **Document Categorization:** Helps classify documents by updating beliefs based on observed keywords.
- **Bayesian A/B Testing:** Assists in making decisions based on the results of experiments comparing two options.

---

## Combinatorics

### What is Combinatorics?
**Combinatorics** is the branch of mathematics dealing with combinations and permutations of objects. It is essential in counting problems, optimizing arrangements, and analyzing probabilities.

### Importance in Data Science
Combinatorics helps in:
- **Understanding Sample Spaces:** Determines the total number of possible outcomes.
- **Optimizing Algorithms:** Aids in designing efficient algorithms by reducing complexity.

### What is Permutation?
A **permutation** refers to an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of \(n\) objects is given by:
\[
n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times ... \times 1
\]

### Role of Permutation in Probability
Permutations are used to calculate probabilities in scenarios where the order of outcomes matters, such as arranging contestants in a race.

### What is Combination?
A **combination** is a selection of objects without regard to the order. The number of combinations of choosing \(r\) objects from \(n\) is given by:
\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

### Numeric Example of Combination
Choosing 3 students from a class of 10:
\[
C(10, 3) = \frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 120
\]
