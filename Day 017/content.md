ANOVA: It is a hypothesis testing technique used to compare the means of multiple groups and determine if atleast one group mean is significantly different from others.
Why and when used anova? :- usecase,region
Example: 
Assumptions in Annova: Independence of observations,Normally,Homogeneity of variance,Additivity (defination,importance,assessment)
*To read :* Homogenity test 1>levene's test 2> Bartlett's test

Types of ANOVA: Classification of ANOVA : Based on number factors (one way anova,two way anova,N-way anova),Based on the nature of the groups (Repeated measures anova,mix design anova),Based
on the number of dependent variavle (Multivariate anova)

One way anova : Defination,Mathematical rep:Hypothesis,f stat calculation,example
Two way anova : Defination,math rep: fstat
N-Way anova : Fo analysis of 3 or more factors,Math representation,
Repeated measures ANOVA: Defination,mathematical representation
Mixed design anova : Defination,mathematical rep,example

MANOVA : defination,Mathematical rep,example
POST-HOC tests in ANOVA : to dtetrmine which specific group mean is different from each oter when null hypothesis is different,Two commonly use post hoc: Tukey's HSD,Bonferroni correction(Defination,key feature,,how it works,
example).

CHI-square test: used to determine if there is a significant association b/w catag variables,Introduction,more...
chi-square goodness of fit test: Defination, when to use,mathematical formulation,Assumptions: Data should be in form of counts/freq,Each observation should be independent,The expected frew
for each catag should be atleast 5.

chi - square goodness of fit test example mathematical

Chi sq test of independence: Defination,Contingency table,when to use,Mathematical formulation,Assumptions: Data should be in form of counts/freq,Each observation should be independent,The expected frew
for each catag should be atleast 5.

Application of chi sq test in AI-ML : 1.Feature selection , 2.Model evaluation,3.market basket analysis

Bootstraping : stat method that involves repeatedly sampling data with replacement from an observed dataset to create multiple new dataset.Key idea,Process,Example of bootstraping
Why use bootstraping : Key benifits: Dealing with small sample size,estimating std error,robustness
Application in AI ML:  model evaluation,confidence intervals for performance metrics
Bootstrap confidence intervals : Defination,steps to calc bootstrap confidence intervals: Resampling with replacement,compute stat,distribution of stat,Percentaile method.
Types of  bootstrap : percentile bootstrap,basic bootstrap,bias correlated accelerated
Examples of bootstrap
Mathematical defination of bootstrap confidence intervals
