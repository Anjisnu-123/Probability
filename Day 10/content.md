Distribution                      applications          example
F: used in compare varriance and in ANOVa  to test if multiple group means are equal: comparing the variance in test scores between different teaching

| **Distribution**         | **Applications**                                       | **Example**                                             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Uniform Distribution** | Used in simulations and random number generation.     | Rolling a fair die (all outcomes equally likely).     |
| **Normal (Gaussian) Distribution** | Used in natural and social sciences for phenomena that cluster around a mean. | Heights of individuals in a population.               |
| **Exponential Distribution** | Models time until an event occurs; often used in queuing theory. | Time until the next customer arrives at a store.     |
| **Gamma Distribution**   | Models waiting times for multiple Poisson events.     | Time until k events occur in a Poisson process.      |
| **Beta Distribution**    | Used in quality control and Bayesian statistics.       | Probability of success in a manufacturing process.    |
| **Weibull Distribution** | Reliability analysis and life data analysis.           | Time until failure of a mechanical system.            |
| **Log-Normal Distribution** | Models variables that are positively skewed.         | Stock prices or income distribution.                   |
| **Pareto Distribution**  | Used in economics to describe the distribution of wealth. | Income distribution where a small percentage holds most wealth. |
| **Chi-Squared Distribution** | Used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation for variance. | Testing the goodness of fit for categorical data.     |
| **Student's t Distribution** | Used for estimating population parameters when the sample size is small. | Estimating the mean height of a small sample group.   |
| **F Distribution**       | Used in ANOVA and comparing variances between two populations. | Comparing variances of test scores between two classes. |
