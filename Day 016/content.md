# Topic: Inferential statistics 

**Introduction to inferntial stat :** Defination: how its different from descriptive stat,Key concept: population vs sample,parameters vs stat,Goal of inferential stat: GEneralization,
hypothesis testing,estimation and predictive modeling

**Population vs sample :** Population,sample,why use a sample?
**Parameters vs stat :** Parameter,example,keypoint,Stat: example,keypoints,why is the distiction important.
**Bias vs Variability :** Bias:Types of bias,impact of bias,variability:source of variability:sampling error,natural variability,impact of variability,impact of variability,Relationship b/w bias and variability,bias vs variability,
Goal in stat: minimize the bias and control variability....

**Sampling :** Dfination,Types of sampling: Random sampling:Simple random sampling with replacement,without replacement,startified sampling,cluster sampling,systematic sampling.

**Sampling distribution :** What is sampling dist,CLT,why CLT is important,

**Importance of sample size :** Why is sample size important,small samples: Higher variability ,potential bias,limited statistical power,Large samples: Reduced variability,better representation,
increased statistical error.

**Sampling distributions :** concept of sampling distribution,example,characteristic of sampling distribution

**Standard error :** defination,formula,roles of standard error: estimation of population parameters,construction of confidence intervals,Hypothesis testing
**Poiny estimation :** Defination,example of point estimates: sample mean,sample proportion

**Good point estimate properties :** Unbiasness: Defination,explanation,example,importance, Consistency: Defination,explanation,example,importance,EFFICIENCY: Def,exp,var comparison,example,
Sufficiency(additional proo): def ,math exp,example,importance


**Corelation :coefficient** def,range formula,assumptions,example,spearman's rank: def,range formula,usecaase,corelation matrix, interpreting corelation values: strong corelation > 0.7, moderate corelation 0.3<|r|<=0.7,weak corelation |r|<=0,3

**Confidence Intervals :** what is a confidence interval,component of confidence level: point estimate,margin of error,confidence level,common confidence level,trade-off,formula for population
mean: for large sample sizes,for small sample sizes,math example,confidence interval formula for population proportion

**What is the margin of error :** It is the amount added to and subtracted from the point estimate in a confidence interval,components of margin of error: critical value(z or t)standard error,
formula

**Z-Scores :** Used when population std deviation is known or sample size id large crtitical values for confidence level 90,95,99,**Tscore :** when use?,vary depends on deg of freedom,


**Hypothesis testing :**
Deifnation,Null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis

**Level of significance :** Defination,mathematical rep,interpretation,Type 1 error,example.

**Power or test :** defination,mathematical rep,type 2 error,example

**Types of error :** Type 1 error,type 2 error: defination,consequence,significance level,power of test,example

**Critical value and rejection region :**Critical value,mathematical calculation,rejection region.

# **TEST STAT**
what are test stat: defination,z-test,t-test:single sample ttest,two sample t-test,paired t-test|,chi squared test,ANOVA,

Test stat general formula for ztest and ttest.
**P-value and its interpretation :** defination,mathematical expression,decision rule,example

**Steps in hypothesis testing :** 
- define hypothesis
- select significance levels
- choose appropiate test and calculate test statistics
- Make a decision

**Parametric test :** Defination,Asssumptions of parametric tests:Normality,homogeneity of varriance,interval or ratio scale,example of parametric tests:Ztest,ttest:types(one sample ttest,independent two sample ttest,paired t test),example

**Non-parametric test :** Defination,when to use non parametric test,examples of non parametric tests: mann whitney u test,wilcoxon signed-rank test.

| Feature               | Parametric Tests                         | Non-Parametric Tests                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Assumptions**       | Assume normality and equal variances     | No specific distribution assumptions    |
| **Data Type**         | Interval or ratio                        | Ordinal, nominal, or continuous        |
| **Sample Size**       | Typically requires larger samples        | Can work with smaller samples          |
| **Power**             | Generally more powerful when assumptions are met | Less powerful but more flexible |
| **Examples**          | Z-test, T-test, ANOVA                   | Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis |
