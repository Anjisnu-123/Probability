# Topic: Inferential statistics 

**Introduction to inferntial stat :** Defination: how its different from descriptive stat,Key concept: population vs sample,parameters vs stat,Goal of inferential stat: GEneralization,
hypothesis testing,estimation and predictive modeling

**Population vs sample :** Population,sample,why use a sample?
**Parameters vs stat :** Parameter,example,keypoint,Stat: example,keypoints,why is the distiction important.
**Bias vs Variability :** Bias:Types of bias,impact of bias,variability:source of variability:sampling error,natural variability,impact of variability,impact of variability,Relationship b/w bias and variability,bias vs variability,
Goal in stat: minimize the bias and control variability....

**Sampling :** Dfination,Types of sampling: Random sampling:Simple random sampling with replacement,without replacement,startified sampling,cluster sampling,systematic sampling.

**Sampling distribution :** What is sampling dist,CLT,why CLT is important,

**Importance of sample size :** Why is sample size important,small samples: Higher variability ,potential bias,limited statistical power,Large samples: Reduced variability,better representation,
increased statistical error.

**Sampling distributions :** concept of sampling distribution,example,characteristic of sampling distribution

**Standard error :** defination,formula,roles of standard error: estimation of population parameters,construction of confidence intervals,Hypothesis testing
**Poiny estimation :** Defination,example of point estimates: sample mean,sample proportion

**Good point estimate properties :** Unbiasness: Defination,explanation,example,importance, Consistency: Defination,explanation,example,importance,EFFICIENCY: Def,exp,var comparison,example,
Sufficiency(additional proo): def ,math exp,example,importance

**Confidence Intervals :** what is a confidence interval,component of confidence level: point estimate,margin of error,confidence level,common confidence level,trade-off,formula for population
mean: for large sample sizes,for small sample sizes,math example,confidence interval formula for population proportion

**What is the margin of error :** It is the amount added to and subtracted from the point estimate in a confidence interval,components of margin of error: critical value(z or t)standard error,
formula

**Z-Scores :** Used when population std deviation is known or sample size id large crtitical values for confidence level 90,95,99,**Tscore :** when use?,vary depends on deg of freedom,
