Topic:
Random variable
Introduction to random var:
what is random var: with example, what is deterministic var,why do we need random variable.
why do we need random var instead of deterministic variables?key benefit of rando var over deterministic var,role of random var in probability
Notations of random var,examples of random variable
Notations and examples of deterministic variables
differenc e b/w random var and deterministic var

classification of random var: discrete,continuous,categorical,binary,multinomial
discrete random variables: overview,formal definition,Example
probability mass function(PMF): definition,mathematics =,key prop, pmf calculation method,steps for pmf calculation,examples
Why do we need PMF: modeling real world scenario,calculating expected value(mean),risk assessment,predictive modeling,
CDF for PMF: defination,math,key prop,calculating method,examples
why do we need CDF?: describing dist behaviour, comparing random var, modeling and simulation,tail probabilities


Introduction to moments: types of moments(Raw moments,central moments)
What is moment and wht do we need them?: formal defination of moments,mathematical formula ,need for moment : central tendency,dispersion or spread,asymmetry,peakness,why are moments important

Note: Will check steps of EDA and non parametric distributon

formula for raw moments and central moments


Caculating specific moments: Mean(first moment),variance(second central moments) and std deviation,skewness(third central limit),kurtosis(Fourth central limits)


Exploring continuous random variables: Defination,real world example,stat prop,imp in stat

Introduction and defination: overview,formal defination,example: time taken to complete a task

probability density function(PDF): what is it? defination,math,calculation method
